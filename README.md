# Fabric Example Mod with StationAPI and BIN Mappings for beta 1.7.3 server + client

## Setup

[See the StationAPI wiki.](https://github.com/ModificationStation/StationAPI/wiki)

## Common Issues

**I get "Invalid source release: 17" as an error!**  
Use Java 17. Open up `File > Project Structure` and change your SDK to Java 17.  
If you still get the issue, you may need to go into `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle` and change the Java that Gradle uses too.
